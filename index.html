            <h4>Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Using Graph Neural Networks</h4>

                    The security problems of smart contracts have
                    drawn extensive attention due to the enormous financial
                    losses caused by vulnerabilities. Existing
                    methods on smart contract vulnerability detection
                    heavily rely on fixed expert rules, leading to low
                    detection accuracy. In this paper, we explore using
                    graph neural networks (GNNs) for smart contract
                    vulnerability detection. Particularly, we construct a
                    contract graph to represent both syntactic and semantic
                    structures of a smart contract function. To
                    highlight the major nodes, we design an elimination
                    phase to normalize the graph. Then, we propose
                    a degree-free graph convolutional neural network
                    (DR-GCN) and a novel temporal message propagation
                    network (TMP) to learn from the normalized
                    graphs for vulnerability detection. Extensive experiments
                    show that our proposed approach significantly
                    outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting
                    three different types of vulnerabilities. </p>

                    The protection of digital resource copyrights has drawn extensive public concern in the past decade.
                    Traditional methods, however, fail to satisfy the requirements due to their poor timeliness,
                    frequent infringement, and cumbersome in rights confirmation, etc. In this paper, we investigate and
                    design a novel approach for cross-platform digital resource rights confirmation and infringement
                    tracking based on smart contracts. We utilize smart contracts to realize rights transactions and
                    protection. As another contribution, we propose to establish fine-grained digital resource rights,
                    which are divided into ownership and usufruct. For tracking infringement acts, we invoke smart
                    contracts to extract the rights transfer chain for resources. Furthermore, we reveal the source of
                    resource leakage by embedding digital watermarks when distributing the resources. By combining
                    resource rights transfer chain and digital watermarking, we can effectively achieve digital resource
                    rights confirmation and infringement tracking. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our
                    proposed method.

                    In the last decade, smart contract security issues lead to tremendous losses, which has attracted
                    increasing public attention both in industry and in academia. Researchers have embarked on efforts
                    with logic
                    rules, symbolic analysis, and formal analysis to achieve encouraging results in smart contract
                    vulnerability
                    detection tasks. However, the existing detection tools are far from satisfactory. In this paper, we
                    attempt
                    to utilize the deep learning-based approach, namely bidirectional long-short term memory with
                    attention
                    mechanism (BLSTM-ATT), aiming to precisely detect reentrancy bugs. Furthermore, we propose contract
                    snippet representations for smart contracts, which contributes to capturing essential semantic
                    information
                    and control owdependencies. Our extensive experimental studies on over 42,000 real-world smart
                    contracts
                    show that our proposed model and contract snippet representations signicantly outperform
                    state-of-the-art
                    methods. In addition, this work proves that it is practical to apply deep learning-based technology
                    on smart
                    contract vulnerability detection, which is able to promote future research towards this area.
